# TESTING WITH RSPEC AND RAILS
This project uses my [getting started project](https://github.com/gabrielcostasilva/rails-getting-started.git) as use case for carrying out BDD tests using RSpec with Rails.

> One can follow along the entire process by checking out each commit in this project.

## Project Overview
To getting started, one can follow [rspec-rails instructions](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails). These instructions will help to setup the project and to create a very first test.

In addition, you may want to mock objects, which we did in a [later commit](https://github.com/gabrielcostasilva/rails-rspec-testing/commit/4dcfeed6ec54b85c01ab1edf64a8396698b9731e).
